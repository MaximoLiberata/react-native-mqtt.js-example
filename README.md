# MQTT.js implementation example for React Native

This is a simple example of how to use [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) in a React Native project. This example also is using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) to make it easier to run the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the MQTT broker settings
4. Run the project with `npm start`
5. Open the project in your device using the [Expo Go APP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) reading the QR code that will appear in the terminal.
6. Publish a message from your MQTT Broker

## Config MQTT.js in React Native

React Native (RN) doesn't support some technologies as web browsers does, in RN the mqtt client always will be established from a `WebSocket` instance, for that reason you need some extra packages to make it work. Here is a list of the packages that you need to install to make it work:

- [url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url)
- [buffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer)

Also some packages of `mqtt` library use `process.nextTick` function, to prevent errors with those packages you need to add the following line of code to your entry file (in this project is `App.js`):

```
process.nextTick = (callback) => {
    setTimeout(callback, 0)
}
```

## Motivation

I was looking for a simple example of how to use MQTT.js in a React Native project, but I couldn't find any. So I decided to create this example to help others that are looking for the same thing. In the process I found a issue with the `mqtt` package that I had to fix, the PR is in [(#1840)](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/pull/1840) if you want to check it out.
